# üç™üêç Cookiecutter for Python package

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for making new Python package repositories.

This template uses the `hatch` build backend, `mkdocs` for the documentation website, and `typer` for the optional CLI. If you're looking for something similar but not quite
like this see this [list of alternatives templates](https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#similar-cookiecutter-templates).


## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Install `cookiecutter` with:

```shell
pip install cookiecutter
```

2. Run `cookiecutter` with:

```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/cookiecutter-python-package
```

3. Enter the requested information, then win! Remember, package names should only have letters, numbers, and dashes.

4. If you're working under version control, copy the repository into your folder tracked under git, commit the files, and push to your remote.
